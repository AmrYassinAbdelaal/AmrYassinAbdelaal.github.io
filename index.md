## Summary
Senior AI/NLP Engineer and Tech Lead with 6+ years building LLM-powered assistants and knowledge-graph products end to end.
At Implicit (formerly Agolo), I led the Answers team and shipped a GraphRAG customer-support chatbot built on a Neo4j knowledge graph and self-hosted Llama models.
I designed a German-language Q&A system (Neo4j + GPT-4), built RAG-based entity-centric summarizers, and developed a PDF parsing pipeline blending rule-based extraction with YOLO.
I focus heavily on reliability—e.g., FactAlign, a KG-aligned hallucination detection approach—while leading teams from early concept through delivery.
