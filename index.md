## Summary
Senior AI/NLP Engineer and Tech Lead with 6+ years building LLM-powered assistants and knowledge-graph products end to end.
At Implicit (formerly Agolo), I led the Answers team and shipped a GraphRAG customer-support chatbot built on a Neo4j knowledge graph and self-hosted Llama models.
I designed a German-language Q&A system (Neo4j + GPT-4), built RAG-based entity-centric summarizers, and developed a PDF parsing pipeline blending rule-based extraction with YOLO.
I focus heavily on reliability—e.g., FactAlign, a KG-aligned hallucination detection approach—while leading teams from early concept through delivery.

## Work Experience

### NLP Engineer – Tech Lead, Implicit (formerly Agolo) (Dec 2020 – Present)
- Led the **Answers Team**, shipping a customer support chatbot using **GraphRAG**, **Neo4j**, and **self-hosted Llama** models  
- Designed a **German-language Q&A system** using **Neo4j + GPT-4** for answering from product manuals  
- Led summarization work for **PDFs, news, and ESG reports**, including **RAG-based** and **entity-centric KG summarizers**  
- Fine-tuned **Llama** models for domain-specific generation and summarization  
- Built a PDF parsing system combining **rule-based extraction** with **YOLOv7** for complex documents  
- Worked on **FactAlign**, an unsupervised **KG-based hallucination detection** approach using KG alignment  

### Research Assistant, Biomedical & Neuro Engineering Lab (Dec 2018 – Dec 2020)
- Built feature extraction + classification pipelines for neural spiking data using **SVM** and **PCA**  
- Achieved ~99% accuracy on simulated data; ~81% on experimental ALS-model mice data using ensemble methods  

### Teaching Assistant, Ain Shams University (Sep 2016 – Mar 2020)
- TA and grader across courses including Neural Networks, DSA, Computer Vision, Digital Image Processing, and more
